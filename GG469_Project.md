# GG 469 Wint 2022 - Project Outline

Create a design for a Natural Heritage System (Greenlands System) for the City of Brampton, Ontario. Work primarly within the study area but consider adjacent areas and there effect on your design.  Use, Forman, R.T.T. Some general principles of landscape and regional ecology. Landscape Ecol 10, 133â€“142 (1995) as a primary source to understand the basic tenants of a good natural heritage system design.

## Part I: Analysis

### Specific Tasks:

1. Designate Core areas
2. Designate Existing Corridor connections
3. Designate Potential Corridors
4. Plot your design indicating existing land use and the three components of the Natural Heritage system: Core areas, Existing Corridors, and Potential Corridors

## Part II: Dissemination

Create a web map application using R/RStudio/leaflet to communicate your system design.

### Specific Tasks:

1. Write fully commented R code to create a new leaflet map widget and add the elements of your Natural Heritage System components as shapefiles to the map widget.
2. Use addTiles() to add a background map to the map widget. (see the provided text file "leafletshapeex.txt" to see an example of adding shapefiles to a leaflet map widget)


## GIS Processes

- Define site boundary
- Add Source Layers
- Separate ELC land uses into separate land use types
    - Woodlands
    - Wetlands
    - Watercourses
    - Cultural features
    - Agriculture
    - Development
- 



## Difficulties

- Collaborations, No effective Multi-User GIS software, 
- Data Sources, Variations in source data availability,
    - Only Raster Imagery Available was Provided .TIF from 1996, original plan was to get addition imagery for modern date to provide comparison. 
- Automation/ Mechanization of organization of a organic/ Natural feature structure
-
