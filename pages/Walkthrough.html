    <h1>Project Breakdown (Process)</h1>

    <p>
        <b>Data Acquisition and Analysis</b> - Reviewing all provided data and its metadata, and selecting additional,
        external data sets based on our discussions of project scope.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Creation of Study Area</b> - Course provided data included a file of 28 separate .TIF Landsat imagery files,
        each a square with an edge length of 2.5km and an area of 6.25km². When all layers were projected they form a
        square with an area of approx. 175km², however each of the external images had a black "border".
    
        Boarder was removed by adding "0" to the No Data Value property for the layer, which is remove some pixels from
        withing the map that had a value of "0", however it seamed a suitable workaround that did not ultimately affect
        the outcome of the map. The resulting image had an approx. area of 112km², and became the boundary for the
        remainder of the project. (See Before and after pictures)

    **Separation of Land-use Features** - The primary layer used in this project was "elc_cvc_nad83v2sel", mapping
    the Ecological Land Classification (ELC) of our study area, preformed by Credit Valley Conservation (CVC). Using
    the Split Vector Layer tool, selecting for 'TYPE' we were able to create separate layers for all 23 types.

    Due to the timeframe and relative scope of this project we were less concerned on the exact ELC type (eg.
    Coniferous Forest) and more on the overarching land use (e,g Forest), for this reason we then merged similar
    types. This left us with layers for Woodlands, Wetlands, Cultural Lands, Developed Lands, and Agricultural
    lands.

    Clipped the Watercourse layer from Ont_GeoHub, then using the Attributes table manually selected each segment of
    the credit river and merged to create a single "CreditRiver_Main", then used the Difference tool with that to
    separate all the tributaries off of the main, saving and labeling them "CreditRiver_Tribs".

    **Determining Areas for NHS Growth** - With the objective of strengthening or enlarging the existing natural
    areas, we had to define where we could realistically expand. The conclusion was that agricultural lands were the
    most likely candidate for naturalizations and that any 'Urban' or 'Developed' area would be out of bounds. Using
    our groups research on best practices, we determined that expanding our existing natural areas by a 60 meter
    buffer would provide a significant increase in protection for most terrestrial and aquatic species likely found
    in this area. Buffers ranging from 20 meter to 120 meters were applied to the land uses types in varying
    combinations, but ultimately a consistent 60 meter buffer on all types seamed most pragmatic. We then removed
    any buffer area that fell within the "Developed" layer" ensuring our NHS would only grow into agricultural
    areas. (See "NHS_Feature")

    **Formatting Layer for Leaflet** - The final portion of work done in QGIs was to optimize for decimation, in
    this case interactive web mapping using [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/SlavaUkraini/). Our objective here
    was to create separate, selectable features for Core Area, Corridor Area and Steppingstone Areas. Using the
    'NHS_Features_Final', we manually delineated each feature (which were comprised of the woodland, wetland, and
    cultural areas), creating separate shape files for each. This resulted in 100 shape files, which were then
    merged into the single part layer 'NHS_Features_Leaflet', as saved in the projection WGS84 (EPSG:4326), the
    preferred projection for Leaflet. There appeared to be no effective way to automate the delineation of features
    as it was not based on attributes but rather by visual extend - which areas look like core vs corridor based on
    size and shape. (See image of "NHS_Features_Leaflet" with a feature selected.)
